# `ortac` examples

:warning: These examples use the development branch of `ortac`, you won't have
the same result with the released version. :warning:

This package centralises examples of libraries with their Gospel
specifications. `ortac` is then used to generate code with runtime assertion
checking. This is thought both as a learning ressource and a way to experiment
with the limitations of the `ortac` tool which is still quite young.

Specifications are written in a style that allows the use the `ortac` tool,
specifically the `qcheck-stm` plugin.

## `lwt_dllist` library

This is an example of relatively simple, yet not trivial, container library.
The specifications make use of the Gospel `sequence` type (for more
information, see [its
documentation](https://ocaml-gospel.github.io/gospel/gospel/Gospelstdlib/Sequence/index.html).

Specifications for this library can be found in the edited copy of the
interface `lwt_dllist_spec.mli`. There is one modification of the actual
interface: the type `'a node` is not abstract anymore. This is necessary in
order to extend the `STM.ty` type with a `Node` constructor. For the
typechecker to accept this extension, the implementation of the `node` type
need to be visible.

The STM `postcond` function pattern match on the returned value encapsulated in
a `STM.ty`. As functions `add_l` and `add_r` both return the node that has been
added, we need to extend the `STM.ty` type with an encoding for
`Lwt_dllist.node`. We add this extension in the configuration module for
Ortac/QCheckSTM.

The generated code can be found in `lwt_dllist_tests.ml`. You can run the test
either with `dune runtest examples/` or by directly running the compiled
executable that you will find in your `_build` directory.

Dune rules have been generated using the `dune-rules` plugin, providing the
`dune` subcommand:

```sh
$ ortac dune qcheck-stm lwt_dllist_spec.mli lwt_dllist_config.ml lwt_dllist_tests.ml --package=ortac-examples --with-stdout-to=dune.lwt_dllist.inc
```

## `varray` library

This is an example of a library exposing a Functor. In order to test a Functor,
it is necessary to instantiate it. The
[`varray`](https://github.com/art-w/varray) library already exposes some
instantiations of its Functor. Here, we provide generated tests for two of them.

The signature of the output of the Functor is originally placed in a `ml` file.
`varray_sig.ml` is a copy of this file with some specifications. As Gospel
doesn't process `ml` files, we extract the content of the module signature and
place a copy in two files: `varray_spec.mli` and `varray_circular_spec.mli`,
the former for the module exposed by `varray` as `Varray` and the latter for
the module exposed by `varray` as `Varray.Circular`. The corresponding `ml`
files are just the respective modules included. Note that we keep the two
dune-generated `mli` files hidden in the `_build` folder.

Here again, as for the previous example, we need to include some code. That is
the extension of the `STM.ty` type. But also a `QCheck` generator for the `'a
elt` type, as some functions of the library take arguments of this type. You
can find these extensions in the `varray_config.ml` and
`varray_circular_config.ml` files.

The generated code can be found in the respective `varray*tests.ml` files. They
have been promoted in the source tree in order to be easily accessible for
reading and curiosity purposes, but this is not necessary for testing purposes.

Dune rules have been generated again using the `dune-rules` plugin with the
following command for `varray_spec.mli` and an adapted version for
`varray_circular_spec.mli`:

```sh
$ ortac dune qcheck-stm varray_spec.mli varray_config.ml varray_tests.ml --package=ortac-examples --with-stdout-to=dune.varray.inc
```

## Treiber stack from Saturn library

This is an example of a parallel-safe library. The
[Saturn](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/saturn) library exposes a number of
lock-free data structures for multicore OCaml. This library is a good candidate
as they are already using hand-written QCheck-STM tests.

Note that we don't test exactly the same subset of functions from the Treiber
stack API. We don't include `to_seq` because we don't have yet the mean to talk
about OCaml `'a seq` in Gospel. But, as Ortac/QCheck-STM is making a somewhat
advanced use of the QCheck-STM framework, we are able to include `create` and
`of_list` in the generated tests.

For the sake of simplicity, we focus on the Treiber stack implementation. We
reproduce the module's interface in `treiber_stack_spec.mli` and add some
Gospel specifications. The Gospel specifications are the same whether we want
to test in a sequential or in a parallel context.

The only difference between the sequential use-case and the parallel one is
that in the latter we add the `--domain` flag to the ortac command. The dune rules that will allow to generate and execute the QCheck-STM tests corresponding to the Gospel specifications can be generated by the following command:

```sh
$ ortac dune qcheck-stm treiber_stack_spec.mli --package=ortac-examples --domain
```
