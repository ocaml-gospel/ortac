  "Ortac (OCaml Runtime Assertion Checking) core tool and library based on Gospel"
description: """
Ortac (OCaml Runtime Assertion Checking) is a tool to turn
executable Gospel specifications into code to test they hold.
Ortac Core provides:
- a library to turn Gospel terms and types into OCaml expressions
  and types,
- and a command-line tool.
You will need at least one of the Ortac plugins to actually
generate test code.
