                  ^^^^^^^
Warning: Skipping incr: model value is declared as modified by the function
         but no suitable ensures clause was found. Specifications should
         contain at least one "ensures x.value = expr" where x is the SUT and
         expr can refer to the SUT only under an old operator and can't refer
         to the returned value.
