  (** Implementation of the Gospel Stdlib

      Note: [bag] and [set] are implemented as decreasing sorted lists where
      each element appears at most once, using the polymorphic comparison.

      For [bag]s, the list contains pairs, where [snd x] is the number of
      occurrences of [fst x], with [snd x > 0].

      Rationale: obviously, the time complexity of these implementations is not
      ideal, but:

      - it is a purely functional implementation (so it can be used with
        QCheck-STM),
      - it is compatible with the polymorphic equality: Ortac uses OCaml's [(=)]
        to implement Gospel's [(=)], this ensures that [set]s and [bag]s can be
        tested for equality in the generated code,
      - they are sorted in decreasing order so that the resulting order
        (according to the polymorphic comparison) on sets and bags is more
        natural. *)
